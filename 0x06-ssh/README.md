What you should learn from this project

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

    What is a server
    Where server usually live
    What is SSH
    How to create an SSH RSA key pair
    How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair

Requirements

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    All your Bash script files must be executable
    The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
    The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash for instance is that it will make your script portable for different OS where Bash might be in a different location.
Congratulations on your first server!
