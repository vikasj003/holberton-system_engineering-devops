`Requirements`
 
 This project will be manually reviewed:
        As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
        Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
        For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
        After pushing your answer file to Github, insert the Github file link into the URL box
